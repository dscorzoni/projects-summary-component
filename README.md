## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I've learned how to use media queries to make minor changes to styling for responsiveness. In this case, the change was made in the borders of the Your Result box.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  article .your-result {
    border-radius: 0rem 0rem 2rem 2rem;
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Using Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - Great explanation on how media queries work and many examples.
